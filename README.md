Yeah so, I'm gonna dump the TerraHaul IAUVs here, maybe more models if I make more.
Currently, TerraHaul only exists because I made a company with my friend and I wanted a small utility ship for getting bult items around the planet/base. Theese IAUVs are not intended to go all-so-fast, so they're at 50.
And, IAUV stands for In Planet Utility Vehicle. I also provided a place for a unit number, if you wish to employ more than one in your fleet or just want the aesthetic.


Note there is no "Gen 1" because gen 1 was not made in studio.
There may be a bug with the polysilicon that it isnt in flipflop mode, so you'll have to change it yourself because I dont know how.
